        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Ciarlo Software, LLC&#39;s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including via our app, Fuel, and its associated services. </p>
<p>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use an app or online service. </p>
<p>In the event our app contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our app. </p>
<p>This policy is effective as of 28 September 2021. </p>
<p>Last updated: 28 September 2021 </p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: &ldquo;voluntarily provided&rdquo; information and &ldquo;automatically collected&rdquo; information. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Voluntarily provided&rdquo; information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using our app and its associated services. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Automatically collected&rdquo; information refers to any information automatically sent by your device in the course of accessing our app and its associated services. </p>
<h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>
<p>We may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following on our website: </p>
<ul>
   <li>Use a mobile device or web browser to access our content</li>
   <li>Contact us via email, social media, or on any similar technologies</li>
   <li>When you mention us on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with general information or research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example, If you consent to us accessing your social media profiles, we may combine information sourced from those profiles with information received from you directly to provide you with an enhanced experience of our app and services. </p>
<h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. </p>
<p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. </p>
<p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring you do not make your personal information publicly available via our platform. </p>
<h4>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal information such as an email address when contacting us about a specific enquiry, we may retain this information for the duration of your enquiry remaining open as well as for our own records so we may effectively address similar enquiries in future. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. </p>
<p>However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. </p>
<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information about children under 13. </p>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any parties who acquire us may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, continue to use your personal information according to this policy, which they will be required to assume as it is the basis for any ownership or use rights we have over such information. </p>
<h3>Limits of Our Policy</h3>

        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>User Data</h2>

        <p>Fuel does not store, copy, or transfer any user data <em>except</em> 1) as necessary to save foods, meals, and other user entries to a user's private iCloud database and on device, and 2) to upload, with permission, foods created for use by other Fuel users via Fuel's food search. Fuel connects via Apple provided authentication mechanisms to transfer data to your private iCloud account.</p>

        <p>We firmly believe in privacy and will never utilize tracking cookies or other user-hostile technologies that degrade the user experience.</p>

        <h2>Diagnostic and Usage Data</h2>

        <p>Fuel does not collect or receive any diagnostic or usage data beyond what is provided by Apple as part of our participation in the Apple Developer Program. This diagnostic and usage data includes, but is not limited to, the iOS operating system version, device type, Fuel app version, and any applicable crash logs. Sending diagnostic and usage data to Apple can be enabled or disabled <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202100">within iOS</a> from the Settings app.</p>


        <h2>Third-Parties</h2>

        <p>Fuel transfers your food data to the iCloud service maintained and operated by Apple and connected to your Apple ID.</p>

        <p>Fuel integrates with two third-party partners: 1) We use RevenueCat to request information about in-app purchases using Apple-provided methods. We do not store or collect any identifying information using these requests. User identities generated within Fuel for RevenueCat are anonymous. 2) Fuel uses Typesense for search results. Typesense does not store, copy, or transfer any user data. The integration with the search service is purposely dumb and only returns truncated versions of food data in response to a user query.</p>

        <h2>Website</h2>

        <p>The Fuel app website located at <code>getfuelapp.com</code> integrates with Google Analytics to track industry-standard metrics. These metrics include but are not limited to referrals, visit duration, and visitor origin.</p>

        <p>The Fuel website does not use tracking cookies beyond those provided by Google Analytics.</p>
