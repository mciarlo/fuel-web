        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Privacy is designed into the products I build as an independent maker. I personally audit all third-party services and go out of my way to avoid collecting personal information. I believe the practice of bulk data collection and tracking is wrong.</p>

        <p>Most of the specifics in this privacy policy likely won&rsquo;t apply to you if you haven&rsquo;t signed up for email updates or contacted me with a question. While there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion of personal information, all of Fuel&rsquo;s features and integrations operate anonymously.</p>

        <p>No data is saved or copied when verifying subscription purchases. Searches log only your IP address and are not accessible by Fuel directly. These IPs are deleted automatically by our search provider after 90 days. Anonymous search terms are saved to find cases where no food matches are found.</p>

        <p>Fuel doesn&rsquo;t store, copy, or transfer any user data <em>except</em> 1) as necessary to save foods, meals, and other user entries to your private iCloud database and on device, and 2) to upload, with permission, foods created for inclusion in Fuel&rsquo;s food search. Fuel connects via Apple provided authentication mechanisms to transfer data to your private iCloud account.</p>

        <p>What follows is boilerplate text designed to make necessary legal clarifications.</p>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>It is Ciarlo Software, LLC's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including via our app, Fuel, and its associated services.</p>

        <p>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use an app or online service.</p>

        <p>In the event our app contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our app.</p>

        <p>This policy is effective as of 29 September 2021.</p>
        <p>Last updated: 7 May 2022</p>
