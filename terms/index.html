        <p>These Terms of Use govern your use of Fuel, our website located at https://fuelcalories.app, and any related services provided by Ciarlo Software, LLC.</p>

        <p>When you use Fuel, you agree to abide by these Terms of Use and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with these Terms of Use, you are prohibited from further using the app, accessing our website, or using any other services provided by Ciarlo Software, LLC.</p>

        <p>If you access or download Fuel from Apple App Store you agree to any Usage Rules set forth in the App Store Terms of Use.</p>

        <p>These Terms of Use were last updated on 29 September 2021.</p>

        <h2>Limitations of Use</h2>
        <p>By using Fuel and our website, you warrant on behalf of yourself, any entity who you represent who has entered into these Terms of Use, and your users that you will not:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>modify, copy, prepare derivative works of, decompile, or reverse engineer Fuel or any materials and software contained within Fuel or on our website;
          <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from Fuel or any materials and software contained within Fuel or on our website;</li>
          <li>transfer Fuel or any of its associated materials to another person or “mirror” the materials on any other server;</li>
          <li>knowingly or negligently use Fuel or any of its associated services in a way that abuses or disrupts our networks or any other service Ciarlo Software, LLC provides;</li>
          <li>use Fuel or its associated services to transmit or publish any harassing, indecent, obscene, fraudulent, or unlawful material;</li>
          <li>use Fuel or its associated services in violation of any applicable laws or regulations;</li>
          <li>use Fuel to send unauthorized advertising or spam;</li>
          <li>harvest, collect, or gather user data without the user’s consent;</li>
          <li>use Fuel or its associated services in such a way that may infringe the privacy, intellectual property rights, or other rights of third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The intellectual property in the materials in Fuel and on our website are owned by or licensed to Ciarlo Software, LLC. You may download Fuel, to view, use, and display the application on your mobile device for your personal use only.</p>

        <p>This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions or these Terms of Use, and may be terminated by Ciarlo Software, LLC at any time.</p>

        <h2>Liability</h2>
        <p>Fuel and the materials in Fuel and on our website are provided on an 'as is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Ciarlo Software, LLC makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.</p>

        <p>In no event shall Ciarlo Software, LLC or its suppliers be liable for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising from the use or inability to use Fuel, our website, or any other services provided by Ciarlo Software, LLC or the materials in Fuel, even if Ciarlo Software, LLC or an authorized representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.</p>

        <p>In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.</p>

        <p>Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

        <h2>Accuracy of Materials</h2>
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, Ciarlo Software, LLC does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials in Fuel or on our website, or otherwise relating to such materials or on any resources linked to Fuel and our website.</p>

        <h2>Suggestions</h2>

        <p>If Fuel fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price of the mobile application to you.
