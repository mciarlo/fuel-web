        <div class="right-content">
          <p>Measuring your food can feel overwhelming, but it’s the best tool you have to be sure you’re eating what you’re tracking. A food scale gives you the ability to learn portion sizes and sets you up for long term success. Adapting to your changing activity and calorie needs is easier when you know what you’re eating.</p>
          <p>Most food scales available in stores work well for daily tracking and can last years. Place your plate or container on the scale and look for the tare option. This will bring the scale to zero and make it ready to weigh your portions.</p>
          <p>Keep a spare battery or two and you'll be able to track uninterrupted.</p>

          <h2><img src="../images/guide_icon_02.svg"/> Dining out</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="right-content">
          <p>Most restaurant food contains more calories than cooking at home. Many times it's the result of added cooking oils and other ingredients that add flavor.</p>
          <p>Consider ordering foods that have known ingredients or where high-calorie ingredients are unlikely to get added.</p>
          <p>If you know you'll have less flexibility, try to pick the most healthy option. These are typically lean cuts of meat or veggie dishes. You can also prepare ahead of time by eating less carbohydrates and fat.</p>
          <p>If calorie or nutrient information isn't available for something you ate, you can always estimate the details by tracking the basic ingredients. For example you might track a slice of cake by logging yellow cake and cream cheese frosting.</p>
          <p>Remember that a time out on the town or ordering takeout isn't the end of the world. Continue to be mindful of your calorie window from week to week and focus on consistency.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="right-content">
          <p>Eating the things you enjoy is part of a balanced approach to nutrition and health. Much like with dining out, the strategies are the same.</p>
          <p>Be mindful of how your treat may affect your macronutrients and adjust your intake beforehand accordingly.</p>
          <p>You can also lower your calorie intake the day after to make up for any overindulgence.</p>
          <p>If you have no underlying health conditions, knowing what and how much you eat is a powerful tool. Cake, cookies, and even pizza become fuel for your body with known limits and ranges.</p>
          <p>As you adapt your lifestyle, use the knowledge and insights you gain from tracking your diet as evidence of your self control and empowerment.</p>

          <h2><img src="../images/guide_icon_04.svg"/> The truth about net carbs</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="right-content">
          <p>Net carbs are everywhere. Unfortunately the term has no formal legal definition and isn't recognized by the FDA or American Diabetes Association.
          <p>Net carbs are calculated by subtracting sugar alcohol and fiber totals from the carbohydrate total of a food. Unfortunately this approach is flawed. To quote the American Diabetes Association:</p>
          <blockquote>&ldquo;This is assuming that fiber and sugar alcohols are not absorbed or metabolized, but this is not always true... [T]he contribution of fiber and sugar alcohols to total carbohydrates depends on the types present.&rdquo;</blockquote>
          <p>Tracking carbohydrates like other macronutrients is the best recommendation for accuracy. Nutrition labels are often embellished to make claims about net carbs without considering the actual impact on blood glucose.</p>

          <h2><img src="../images/guide_icon_05.svg"/> Tuning your macros</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="right-content">
          <p>Set up your macronutrients based on your goals and lifestyle. Use a built-in preset or create your own ratio. Experimenting to see what makes you feel your best is expected.</p>

          <p>Most people can have positive results from one of the preset, and can lose or gain weight by adjusting their overall calories. Macro ratios will update proportionally.</p>

          <p>Some alternate strategies depend on specific dietary needs. Athletes should keep their protein and carbohydrate intake high to fuel workouts and recovery. People trying to lower body fat during extended weight loss periods may opt to lower fat or carbohydrates to keep protein levels consistent. Remember the impact of proteins and fats on feeling satisfied after a meal and their importance in maintaining lean body pass and regulating hormones.</p>

          <p>Talk to your doctor before making any drastic changes to your eating habits.</p>

          <h2><img src="../images/guide_icon_06.svg"/> Filling foods</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="right-content">
          <p>One of the biggest challenges when trying to lose weight is feeling full. We often miss the feeling of "being stuffed" when what we really need is to finish a meal feeling satisfied.</p>

          <p>The best kinds of meals and snacks for satiety usually include a healthy serving of protein and fiber. This includes lean meats and water-rich fruits and vegetables. It&rsquo;s also important to avoid sodas and fruit juices that are high in sugar. Highly processed foods and items high in sugar can cause hunger more quickly due to the quick rise and fall of blood sugar levels.</p>

          <p>Filling, healthy meals don&rsquo;t have to be boring or bland. A 2017 study by researchers at Laval University found that people who ate meals high in satiety — like a stir-fry - lost more weight and ate less later in the day.</p>

          <p>Some good foods to keep around the house include cottage cheese, eggs, avocados, lentils, oatmeal, greek yogurt, salad, and almonds."</p>
