          <p>Measuring your food can feel overwhelming, but it’s the best tool you have to be sure you’re eating what you’re tracking. A food scale gives you the ability to learn portion sizes and sets you up for long term success. Adapting to your changing activity and calorie needs is easier when you know what you’re eating.</p>
          <p>Most food scales available in stores work well for daily tracking and can last years. Place your plate or container on the scale and look for the tare option. This will bring the scale to zero and make it ready to weigh your portions.</p>
          <p>Keep a spare battery or two and you'll be able to track uninterrupted.</p>
